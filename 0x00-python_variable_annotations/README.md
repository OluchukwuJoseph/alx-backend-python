# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations
## Description
This project introduces type annotations in Python, which are a way to add hints about the types of variables, function arguments, and return values. Type annotations improve code readability, make it easier to understand the expected types, and help tools like linters and IDEs catch potential bugs. This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and aims to teach the fundamentals of Python's type hinting system, which is essential for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, i:

- Understood the concept of type annotations and their importance.
- Learnt how to add type hints for variables, function arguments, and return values.
- Became familiar with Python's built-in types and the typing module for more complex types.
- Knew how to annotate lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, and other data structures.
- Understood the benefits of type hints in improving code quality and debugging.
