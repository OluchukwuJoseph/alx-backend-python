# 0x01. Python - Async Functions
## Description
This project explores the concept of asynchronous programming in Python using async functions. Asynchronous programming allows tasks to run concurrently and improves the efficiency of applications that involve I/O-bound operations. This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and aims to introduce the fundamental concepts of asynchronous programming, including coroutines, event loops, and async / await syntax.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I:

- Understood the benefits of asynchronous programming.
- Learnt how to define and call async functions.
- Understood the role of event loops in asynchronous execution.
- Know how to await async functions to retrieve results.
- Became familiar with handling exceptions in async code.
