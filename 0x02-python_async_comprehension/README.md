# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension
## Description
This project introduces asynchronous programming in Python, focusing on async comprehensions and their practical applications. Async comprehensions allow for efficient and non-blocking operations when dealing with asynchronous iterators, making them useful in scenarios where performance and scalability are essential.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this project, i:

- Understood the concept of asynchronous programming in Python.
- Learnt how to use async for loops with asynchronous iterators.
- Mastered the syntax and usage of async comprehensions.
- Combined asyncio methods with async comprehensions for better performance.
- Gained familiarity with asyncio.gather for concurrent execution.
